# Student-Marks-Predictor

# **Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting student marks based on the number of study hours. The goal is to leverage a simple linear regression model to establish a relationship between study hours and expected marks, thereby enabling students and educators to estimate academic performance.

# **Project Summary:**
The project involves several key steps:

- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Data on student study hours and corresponding marks is collected and preprocessed for model training.
- **Data Visualization:** Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between study hours and marks, providing insights into the data distribution.
- **Model Training:** A simple linear regression model is trained using the training dataset to learn the relationship between study hours and marks.
- **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using a test dataset to assess its predictive performance.
- **Model Saving:** The trained model is saved for future use in predicting student marks based on study hours.

# **Used Tools:**
- **Python:** The programming language used for implementing the project.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
- **Joblib:** For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.

# **Final Conclusion:**
The project successfully developed a linear regression model to predict student marks based on study hours. The model demonstrated a positive correlation between the number of study hours and the marks obtained, indicating that increased study time generally leads to higher marks. The saved model can be utilized to make predictions for new data, providing a useful tool for students and educators to estimate academic performance and plan study schedules effectively. The project highlights the potential of machine learning in educational analytics and decision-making processes.
